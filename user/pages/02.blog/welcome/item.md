## Welcome to the Newest Blog for Tech Enthusiests and Professionals!

<p/>

### Introduction

This is the first of what will be many useful posts to tech enthusiests and professionals on our new site built on top of [Grav's flat file CMS](https://getgrav.org).

<p/>

This is a project that our team wanted to start up in order to not only learn about flat file content managers, but to also share with the community useful tutorials and tech news across all subject matters of web development and general open source happenings of intrest to would be readers. 

<p/>

However, this site is no where near completion and there is still much to do! After all, we are learning as we go. Some of the upcoming features include:

- Login Functionality Using Social Media Sites
- Blog Post Commenting
- A More Polished Site Experience

<p/>

In the long term, we would like to incorporate a feature that would allow for user blog post submissions. This would allow others in the community to contribute as well.

###### Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more posts!
